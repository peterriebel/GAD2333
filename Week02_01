//The big point of this assignment is that the variable 'Name' is
//supplied by the user and the function 'Main' takes it and uses
//it to fill in the variable 'somethingelse' when it calls 'SayHello'.
//You had the code working right, but then used 'Hello + Name' which shortcutted
//passing Name to a new variable. In lines 19 and 21 use a different variable, like theName,
//and it should still work fine.
